# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Project Description

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals based on various health-related factors. Early detection of heart disease is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. Through data exploration, statistical analysis, and machine learning modeling, we seek to uncover patterns and insights to assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease.

## Initial Hypotheses and Questions

- Hypothesis 1: Smoking is positively correlated with the presence of heart disease.
- Hypothesis 2: Individuals with a higher BMI are more likely to have heart disease.
- Hypothesis 3: Physical activity is inversely related to heart disease risk.
- Question 1: What role does age play in heart disease?
- Question 2: Are there significant differences in heart disease prevalence among different gender and race groups?

## Project Planning

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize data distributions.
   - Identify correlations and patterns.
   - Formulate initial hypotheses.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Split data into training, validation, and test sets.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Train machine learning models:
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Logistic Regression

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assess model performance using accuracy.
   - Feature importance analysis.
  
5. **Key Findings, Recommendations, and Takeaways**:

    - Smoking is strongly associated with heart disease.
    - BMI is a significant predictor of heart disease.
    - Physical activity may reduce the risk of heart disease.
    - Age plays a crucial role in heart disease risk, with older individuals at higher risk.
Further analysis is recommended to explore gender and race-based differences in heart disease prevalence.

## Resume

**Performed in-depth data analysis and predictive modeling to study the factors influencing heart disease prevalence. Explored a comprehensive dataset, conducted statistical tests, and developed machine learning models. Key findings include strong associations between smoking, BMI, and heart disease, as well as the importance of physical activity and age as risk factors. Provided valuable insights for health professionals and policymakers.**
